- check fire button on real joysticks:
	- on Falcon build it seems to be stuck
	- on SDL build it doesn't work at all
- broken load/save state
- super-slow bank switching (The Asskicker's main menu)
- support unsigned and/or little endian samples
- try to avoid the intermediate sound buffer
- add support for m68k-atari-mintelf-gcc
- compile against SDL with https://github.com/agranlund/SDL-1.2 changes
- update man page (videl options, caps/inverse...)

- eventually merge Falcon and SDL port
